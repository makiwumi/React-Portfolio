      <p>
        I am a full-stack web developer experienced in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Node.js and JavaScript that specializes in front-end web development and applications. In my previous career as a Medical Laboratory Scientist, I worked with laboratory information systems. I was able to team up with programmers to design and improve workflow in the lab. I have enjoyed designing and creating websites since beginning my journey at the Johns Hopkins coding bootcamp. With my background in Art, Photography and my interest in programming, I was recently motivated to turn my passion into a career.  Iâ€™m looking forward to optimizing user experience through design with a team where I can grow, create and learn to master these skills.
